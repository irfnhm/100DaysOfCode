> Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode journey.

# 100DaysOfCode

Inorder to make coding a daily habit, we must code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days and tweet the progress every single day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

With this journey, I have started to learn python programming language and everyday I learn something and publish it here on GitHub. If you wanna learn with me, you're welcome to join me or if you're a professional python developer you may want to help me figure out potential errors in my code and I would love if you do so.
